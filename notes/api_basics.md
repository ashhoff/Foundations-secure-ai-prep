**What is an API, in your own words?**
An API is basically a middleman between apps that helps them talk to each other. It lets one app request info or actions from another app — like asking a website for data.

**What does the response contain?**
The response has the data that the app or website sends back. It could be text, images, links, or whatever info you asked for.

**Why would an API key be useful?**
An API key is useful because it helps keep things secure. It shows who’s using the API and can be used to limit or track access.
