# AI Security Glossary

## Key Terms for AI and Security

### API
 An API is a tool that lets two different software systems talk to eachother. It defines the rulule for how data is requested, shared or updated between them. APIs are what let apps verify your identity through another software, like when I signed into GitHub through VSC.

### API Key
An API key is like a special passcode that a service gives you so your app or script can access their system. It's a way for them to recognize who is making a request amd control what that person or app do.

### Prompt
A prompt is a sentence, question, or set of instructions you give to an AI model. It tells the AI what you want it to do. Prompts can be super simple or really detailed, depending on what kind of response you’re looking for.

### Prompt Injection
Prompt injection is when someone gives an AI a malicious prompt to trick it into revealing information it’s not supposed to. Since AI models are eager to please, attackers try to exploit that by bypassing safety rules and getting access to sensitive data.

## Port
A port is a virtual “door” that a computer uses to send and receive data. Each port is assigned to a specific type of service. For example, websites use port 80 (HTTP) or 443 (HTTPS), while email or file-sharing might use different ports. Ports help keep network traffic organized and secure.

## IP Address
An IP address is like a computer’s address. It identifies a device so that data knows where to go. An IP address tells the internet where to send and receive data for that specific device.

## Socket
A socket connects an IP address (where the data is going) with a port number (what the data is for). It links them together so devices can talk to each other about what they need to.

## Input Validation
Input validation is when the program double-checks what someone types in to make sure it’s the right format, type, or value before using it. This helps prevent errors, bugs, or even someone trying to break the system with malicious input.

## Authentication
Authentication is the process of proving your identity. Think of it like showing your ID to a bouncer. In a system, this usually means entering a username and password that match what’s stored in the database.

## Authorization
Authorization determines what an authenticated user is allowed to access or do in a system, as in their permissions, roles, or scopes. Authentication = who are you? Authorization = what can you do?

## Rate Limiting
Rate limiting is when a system puts a cap on how many requests a user, app or device can make in a certain amount of time. This helps prevent overloading the system, abuse like spam or DDoS attacks.

## Logging
Logging is like a receipt or record of everything that happens between a user and a system. It helps with debugging, monitoring activity, and finding issues. But if sensitive info like passwords or API keys get logged by mistake, it can create security risks.

## Bias (in AI)
Bias in AI is when a system makes unfair decisions because it learned from data that was unbalanced or flawed.

## Audit Trail
Audit trails are detailed logs that track what actions were taken in a system, by who, and when. This is used for security, debugging and compliance.
