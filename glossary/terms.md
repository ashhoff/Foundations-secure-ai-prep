# AI Security Glossary

## Key Terms for AI and Security

### API
 An API is a tool that lets two different software systems talk to eachother. It defines the rulule for how data is requested, shared or updated between them. APIs are what let apps verify your identity through another software, like when I signed into GitHub through VSC.

### API Key
An API key is like a special passcode that a service gives you so your app or script can access their system. It's a way for them to recognize who is making a request amd control what that person or app do.

### Prompt
A prompt is a sentence, question, or set of instructions you give to an AI model. It tells the AI what you want it to do. Prompts can be super simple or really detailed, depending on what kind of response you’re looking for.

### Prompt Injection
Prompt injection is when someone gives an AI a malicious prompt to trick it into revealing information it’s not supposed to. Since AI models are eager to please, attackers try to exploit that by bypassing safety rules and getting access to sensitive data.
